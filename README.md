## Basic Formula
The general formula for calculating the final amount (M) is:

M = P(1 + r)^n + Contribution * [((1 + r)^n - 1) / r]

Where:

- **P** is the initial capital.
- **r** is the interest rate per period.
- **n** is the total number of periods.
- **Contribution** is the amount of monthly contributions.
